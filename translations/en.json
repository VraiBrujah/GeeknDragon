      "p1": "On the first day of the <strong>Festival Ludique International de Montréal</strong>, our very first public demonstration of coins took the form of a <strong>legendary one-shot</strong>. Our coins were tossed like so many dice of destiny. They twirled through the air and landed with a deep metallic chime, instantly sparking wonder. Eyes widened. Voices rose in laughter and amazement. The very fabric of role-playing games had changed.",
      "p2": "None of this would have been possible without our ally on this adventure: <strong>Es-tu Game?</strong>, Quebec’s reference for wild sessions on YouTube. And above all, the indispensable, fabulous <strong>Pierre‑Louis Renaud</strong>. Plot weaver and world smith, he is that legendary GM no archdevil dares challenge. Even in Sigil, the ancients of the multiverse whisper his name with respect—and a hint of envy. If there is a plane where you meet a better game master, it’s surely because Pierre‑Louis has rolled his dice there. And for our greatest delight, he summoned one of his craziest one-shots: a level‑20 adventure of absurd… never-before-seen epic intensity.",
      "p3": "A true fireworks display of controlled chaos, featuring three iconic figures from his past campaigns:",
      "li1": "<strong>Gratis</strong>, played by Dave Belisle (Les Appendices): a gnome artificer as exhilarated as he is uncontrollable, alchemist of sauces with often explosive—and always unknown—effects. To him, offering a drop of his latest concoction is a sign of affection—whether the recipient survives or not. His sauces, unstable as can be, tend to trigger unpredictable effects: gravity inversion, torrents of tears black as fresh ink, or vertical wall waltzes. Even enemies aren’t safe from his spicy generosity.",
      "li2": "<strong>Marlin</strong>, brilliantly portrayed by Jean‑François Provençal (Les Appendices), an illusionist rogue as elusive as he is improbable. A strategist with alternative logic, selectively brave yet disarmingly charming, he stands out for his knack for fleeing with elegance, stealing with panache, and finding himself—without ever seeking it—at the heart of the most absurd situations. It's as if the entire universe conspires to make him the pivot of chaos.",
      "li3": "<strong>Tana</strong>, the unforgettable barbarian with a well-honed axe, played by Rosanne Berry. Feared for her unshakable motto: strike first, think later, ask questions… rarely. She is as famous for her crashing charges as for her sincere tears. A colossus with a tender heart, a true tidal wave of emotion and edge, who certainly didn't expect to face a raccoon—resistant to her blows that could rend the fabric of space-time.",
      "p4": "This unlikely trio thought they would enjoy a peaceful retirement in a sleepy village… until they couldn’t resist swiping a few coins from the awestruck onlookers.",
      "p5": "Marlin and Tana, always seeking a rush of adrenaline, delighted in stealing the small purses of travelers won over by their legend, before the idea of 'theft' even crossed their minds. Gratis, somewhat guilty, followed almost reluctantly, limiting his misdeeds to acts of good-natured daring.",
      "p6": "But the attempted burglary of the mayor’s house was cut short. A rustle in the garbage, an overly curious raccoon and a messy compost threw the operation into chaos, abruptly halting the exploits of our three rogue heroes.",
      "p7": "The climax? A cosmic raccoon sucked into the stars, carried off by reversed gravity, while the mayor, in tears, emptied his vault in a whirlwind of copper and silver coins in tribute to his lost sons, as the audience and the table burst into laughter in total immersion."
