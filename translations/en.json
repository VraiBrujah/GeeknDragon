From now on, each player felt the real weight of the loot, slipping between their fingers like a forgotten heirloom. A treasure become tangible. With every exchange, the whole body reacted: the hesitant hand, the weighing eye, the dry throat. The treasure took shape. It became dramatic stake, visceral emotion, an event, a memorable souvenir...",
