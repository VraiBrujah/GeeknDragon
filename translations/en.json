      "title": "Heroes level 20, an overly tenacious raccoon, and... our coins",
      "p1": "On the first day of the <strong>Festival Ludique International de Montréal</strong>, our very first public demo of coins took the form of a <strong>legendary one-shot</strong>. Our coins were tossed like dice of fate. They spun through the air, landed with a deep metallic chime, and immediately sparked a wave of wonder. Eyes widened. Voices rose in laughter and amazement. The very fabric of role-playing changed.",
      "p2": "None of this would have been possible without our ally in this adventure: <strong>Es-tu Game?</strong>, Quebec's go-to channel for wild sessions on YouTube. And above all, the inimitable, fabulous <strong>Pierre‑Louis Renaud</strong>. Schemer of plots, world-smith, he is that legendary GM whom no archdevil dares challenge. Even in Sigil, the multiverse's elders whisper his name with respect... and a hint of jealousy. If there's a Plane where you meet a better game master, it's probably because Pierre‑Louis rolled his dice there. And for our delight, he summoned one of his craziest one-shots: a level-20 adventure of absurd... epic intensity never seen before.",
      "p3": "A true fireworks of controlled chaos, featuring three cult figures from his past campaigns:",
      "li1": "<strong>Gratis</strong>, played by Dave Belisle (Les Appendices): a gnome artificer as elated as he is uncontrollable, alchemist of sauces with effects often explosive... and always unknown. For him, offering a drop of his latest mixture is a mark of affection – whether the recipient survives or not. His sauces, unstable as can be, tend to trigger unpredictable effects: gravity inversion, torrents of tears as black as fresh ink, or vertical wall waltzes. Even foes are not safe from his spicy generosity.",
      "li2": "<strong>Marlin</strong>, brilliantly portrayed by Jean‑François Provençal (Les Appendices), a thief illusionist as elusive as he is improbable. Strategist with alternative logic, of selective courage but disarming charm, he shines by his propensity to flee gracefully, steal with panache, and find himself – without ever seeking it – at the heart of the most absurd situations. As if the entire universe conspired to make him the pivot of chaos.",
      "li3": "<strong>Tana</strong>, the unforgettable barbarian with the well-sharpened axe, played by Rosanne Berry. Feared for her unshakable motto: hit first, think later, ask questions... rarely. She is as famous for her crushing charges as for her sincere tears. A colossus with a tender heart, a true emotional and slicing tidal wave, who certainly didn't expect to run into a raccoon... resistant to blows capable of rending space-time.",
      "p4": "This unlikely trio thought they'd enjoy a peaceful retirement in a sleepy village... until they couldn't resist snatching a few coins from the dazzled onlookers.",
      "p5": "Marlin and Tana, always looking for a little adrenaline, amused themselves by pilfering the small purses of travelers won over by their legend, before the idea of \u201ctheft\u201d even crossed their minds. Gratis, slightly guilty, followed almost reluctantly, keeping his own misdeeds to harmless acts of bravado.",
      "p6": "But the attempted burglary of the mayor's house was cut short. A rustle in the garbage, an overly curious raccoon and a poorly sorted compost plunged the operation into chaos, abruptly halting the exploits of our three rogue heroes.",
      "p7": "The climax? A cosmic raccoon sucked into the stars, carried off by reversed gravity, while the mayor, in tears, emptied his vault in a whirlwind of copper and silver coins in homage to his lost sons, and the audience and table burst into laughter in total immersion.",
      "p8": "Watch the full session on the official YouTube channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@estugameofficieljdr\" class=\"underline text-indigo-400\" target=\"_blank\">Es-tu Game? — Jeux de rôle</a>",
