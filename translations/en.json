      "p1": "During the first day of the <strong>Montreal International Ludic Festival</strong>, our very first public demonstration of coins took the form of a <strong>legendary one-shot</strong>. We tossed our pieces like dice of destiny. They whirled through the air and landed with a deep metallic chime, immediately sparking a wave of wonder. Eyes widened. Voices rose in laughter and astonishment. The very essence of role‑playing had just changed.",
      "p2": "None of it would have been possible without our ally in this adventure: <strong>Es-tu Game?</strong>, Québec’s go-to channel for wild gaming sessions on YouTube—and above all, the inimitable, fabulous <strong>Pierre‑Louis Renaud</strong>. A master of plotting and a world‑forger, he’s that legendary GM no archdevil dares challenge. Even in Sigil, the eldest sages of the multiverse whisper his name with respect—and more than a hint of envy. For if there is a plane where a better game master exists, it’s only because Pierre‑Louis rolled his dice there first. And for our greatest delight, he unleashed one of his most madcap one-shots: a level‑20 adventure of absurdly epic intensity.",
      "p3": "A true fireworks display of controlled chaos, featuring three cult figures from his past campaigns:",
      "li1": "<strong>Gratis</strong>, played by Dave Belisle (Les Appendices): a gnome artificer as exuberant as he is unmanageable, an alchemist of sauces with effects that are often explosive… and always unpredictable. To him, offering a drop of his latest concoction is a sign of affection—whether the recipient survives or not. His sauces, as unstable as can be, tend to trigger unforeseen effects: reversed gravity, torrents of tears as black as fresh ink, or vertical wall waltzes. Even enemies are not immune to his spicy generosity.",
      "li2": "<strong>Marlin</strong>, brilliantly portrayed by Jean‑François Provençal (Les Appendices), an illusionist rogue as elusive as he is improbable. A strategist of alternative logic, selectively brave but disarmingly charming, he excels in fleeing with grace, stealing with flair, and finding himself—without ever seeking it—in the heart of the most absurd situations. It’s as if the entire universe conspires to make him the pivot of chaos.",
      "li3": "<strong>Tana</strong>, the unforgettable axe-wielding barbarian, embodied by Rosanne Berry. Feared for her unshakable motto: strike first, think later, ask questions… rarely. She’s as famous for her crushing charges as she is for her heartfelt tears. A colossus with a tender heart, a veritable emotional and cutting tidal wave, who certainly didn’t expect to encounter a raccoon… immune to her blows capable of cleaving the fabric of space-time.",
      "p4": "This improbable trio thought they could enjoy a peaceful retirement in a sleepy village—until they couldn’t resist the urge to filch a few coins from the star-struck onlookers.",
      "p5": "Marlin and Tana, forever chasing a thrill, amused themselves by lifting the small purses of travelers dazzled by their legend, before the thought of ‘theft’ even crossed their minds. Gratis, feeling slightly guilty, followed almost reluctantly, limiting his petty crimes to lighthearted acts of bravado.",
      "p6": "But the attempted burglary of the mayor’s residence went awry. A rustle in the trash, an overly curious raccoon, and a poorly sorted compost threw the operation into chaos, abruptly halting our heroic scoundrels’ exploits.",
      "p7": "The climax? A cosmic raccoon sucked into the stars by inverted gravity, while the mayor, in tears, emptied his safe in a whirl of copper and silver coins in homage to his lost sons, and the spectators and table erupted in laughter—completely swept away by the immersion."
